                            Hello! Yes I'm the one making the universe here! Maybe I'm just a
                            novice, but that's what you're here for, right?
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Wait what? You're saying that I'm underqualified for this? How dare you,
                            just because I skipped half of my classes doesn't mean-
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Oh, you meant that I need experience before I can make a universe here?
                            But to get experience I'd need to make a universe, right?
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            So I need experience to make a universe, but need to make a universe to
                            have experience. Jeez, I'm no million-year-old genius but that sounds
                            like a paradox to me.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            No, you cannot take control of this operation, it's mine! You have no
                            authority here, so leave or I'll throw over a septillion particles at
                            you! That oughta leave a dent!
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Yeah you're right, that's barely anything, but still! You have no right!
                            I'll mind my business, and you mind yours! Or you could actually do your
                            job and help me out here!

                        Huh? What is that thing? Dark matter? I thought that was just something scientists
                        made up to confuse teenagers!
                        <br/><br/>
                        I guess it's a real thing then, does that mean that this weird particle just...
                        made its way into my universe?
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Yes it's my universe, we've been over this. Point is, we have a problem on our hands.
                        I thought the Light Particles would be enough to deal with this, but I guess not.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I have no clue what this particle is going to do, but it seems... angry.
                        I know that makes no sense, since particles can't be angry, but-
                        <br/><br/>
                        Oh, so now you think I'm crazy? Alright then, maybe I am, one particle can't
                        do anything too bad, can it? There's clearly nothing to worry about.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Oh wait it just moved, oh no there's a lot to worry about.
                        Time to delete this thing from my universe!
                        <br/><br/>
                        Why... won't... it... just... die!
                        I'll need to find another way...
